## 4156 ASE Unit Testing in Java Demo ##

This is an example of a simple CRUD service that stores data persistently and exposes an API to be used by other developers.
Please pay particular attention to the tests performed in this project and feel free to use them as references
when testing your own project.

Again, please note that unit tests will not be the only kind of tests expected. You should do
integration and API testing as well to ensure you've squashed as many bugs as possible and 
that your service is functioning correctly.
